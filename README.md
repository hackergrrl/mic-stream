> Get a stream of audio data from the microphone.

## Unmaintained
This module is old and doesn't seem to work any longer, and I don't have capacity / interest in maintaining it. Please consider using [node-record-lpcm16](https://github.com/gillesdemey/node-record-lpcm16/) instead.

## wip disclaimer

**Still TODO**: browser support (see #9)!
[microphone-stream](https://github.com/saebekassebil/microphone-stream) ought to
do the trick.

## support

|         | Node | Browser |
|---------|------|---------|
| Windows | NO   | NO      |
| Linux   | *YES*¹ | NO    |
| macOS   | *YES*² | NO    |
| *BSD    | NO   | NO      |

¹ requires `alsa-utils` to be installed.
² requires [`rec` from *sox*](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) to be installed.

## example

Let's pipe our microphone input back to our speakers: feedback loop!

```js
var mic = require('mic-stream')
var speaker = require('audio-speaker')

mic().pipe(speaker())
```

## api

```js
var mic = require('mic-stream')
```

### var stream = mic(format={})

Creates a new [audio-through](https;//github.com/audio-lib/audio-through) stream
from the local microphone. If on the browser, the user may be first asked for
permission.

`format` is an object that decides the format of the audio data received. It
takes a wide variety of parameters. These are defaults:

```
{
  signed: true,
  float: false,
  bitDepth: 16,
  byteOrder: 'LE',  // or BE, if you're on a big-endian system
  channels: 2,
  sampleRate: 44100,
  interleaved: false,
  samplesPerFrame: 44100,
  sampleSize: 2,
  id: 'S_16_LE_2_44100_I',
  max: 32678,
  min: -32768
}
```

The returned `stream` can be treated like a regular Node stream and piped
where ever you'd like.

### stream.stop(cb)

Stops the microphone stream. `cb` is called when the process is fully stopped.

## install

With [`npm`](http://npmjs.org/), run

```
npm install mic-stream
```

For browser use you'll need a tool like [browserify](https://browserify.com).

Node users will need a working install of [sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net).
